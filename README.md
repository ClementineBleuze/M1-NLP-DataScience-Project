## What you will find in this repository
In this repository, you will find:  

- in folder [**code**](code/): source code for this project, in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. This folder is subdivided into [**part1**](code/part1/) and [**part2**](code/part2/), containing the code for part 1 (respectively 2) of the project. Inside these subfolders themselves, Notebooks are named after the subpart of the project they're dedicated to.

- in folder [**data**](data/): datafiles used to conduct the project.  
    - Subfolder [**part1**](data/part1/) contains the texts of the two categories we studied (in subfolders [*US_Presidents*](data/part1/US_Presidents/) and [*Women_Scientists*](data/part1/US_Presidents/)). They are also all saved together in a [.csv file](data/part1/all_articles.csv).   
    - Subfolder [**part2**](data/part2/) contains the [dataset](data/part2/dataset.txt) used for part2. Some data is also saved in the form of .csv files.  

- a [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file
