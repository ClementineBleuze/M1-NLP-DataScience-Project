Ana Maria Rey is a Colombian theoretical physicist, professor at University of Colorado at Boulder, a JILA fellow, a fellow at National Institute of Standards and Technology and a fellow of the American Physical Society.[3] Rey was the first Hispanic woman to win the Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists in 2019.[4]
Rey earned a bachelor's degree in physics at Universidad de los Andes[5] in Bogot√° in 1999 with a magna cum laude distinction.[5] She got her Ph.D. in physics at University of Maryland in 2004.[6] She was a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology from 2004 to 2005 in the group of Charles W. Clark.[5] She went on to work as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (ITAMP) at Harvard University[7] from 2005 to 2008.
After her postdoctoral position at ITAMP, she joined the University of Colorado Boulder Physics Department as an assistant research professor and JILA as an associate fellow in 2008. She was promoted to JILA Fellow in 2012 and shifted her position in the department of Physics to adjoint professor in 2017.[8]
Rey is a theoretical quantum physicist who works on ways of developing new techniques for controlling quantum systems and their applications ranging from quantum simulations/information to time and frequency standards. Her research is often directly applicable to state-of-the-art experiments, in particular to atomic clocks,[9] quantum computing,[10] and precision measurements. Her contibution to the understanding out-of-equilibrium quantum phenomena have led to pioneer measurements of quantum information scrambling, and the synthesis of magnetic and topological quantum materials. Her publications have been cited more than 11,000 times as of 2020.[11]
On July 29, 2000, Rey got married. Two days later, she immigrated to the United States.[1]
The most cited publications by Rey to the date are:[14]
