Tara Keck (born November 26, 1978, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina) is an American-British neuroscientist and Professor of Neuroscience and Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow, at University College London working in the Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology. She studies experience-dependent synaptic plasticity, its effect on behaviour[1] and how it changes during ageing and age-related diseases.[2] She has worked in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund on approaches for healthy ageing.[3][4] Her recent work has focused on loneliness in older people, with a focus on gender.[5][6][7][8] She was named a UNFPA Generations and Gender Fellow in 2022.[9]
Professor Keck attended Harvard University from 1997 to 2001, majoring in bioengineering and then earned a PhD in biomedical engineering from Boston University in 2005, working with John White.[10] She grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania and attended Fairview High School.[11]
Professor Keck completed her postdoctoral research at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Munich, Germany with Tobias Bonhoeffer and Mark HÃ¼bener.[12] She received an MRC Career Development Fellowship from the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) in 2010[13] and subsequently started her own lab at King's College London in the MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology.[14] In 2014, she moved her lab to University College London.[15] In 2018, she was awarded a Senior Research Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust.[16] Professor Keck's work focuses on different forms of synaptic plasticity in the intact brain, with a focus on homeostatic plasticity and changes in plasticity during ageing and age-related diseases.[2] Her work has demonstrated that homeostatic mechanisms in vivo may be implemented at a network level, rather than a single cell level.[17][18][19] She is a recipient of the Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award and the Wekerle Foundation Award[20], and was a finalist for the Max Planck Society Neuroscience Research Award.
