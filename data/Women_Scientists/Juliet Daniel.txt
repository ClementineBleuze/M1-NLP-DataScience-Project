Juliet M Daniel is a Barbadian-born Canadian biology professor at McMaster University, where her research focuses on cancer biology. Daniel is recognized in the cancer biology field for the discovery and naming of the gene Kaiso, and is the recipient of several prestigious awards in recognition of her research and leadership, including an Ontario Premier Research Excellence Award and a Vice-Chancellor Award from the University of the West Indies.
In 1987, Daniel completed a Bachelor's degree in life sciences at Queen's University, and then a PhD in microbiology at the University of British Columbia in 1993.[1][2][3] Daniel completed post-doctoral research fellowships for three years at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and then followed her supervisor's move to Vanderbilt University, in Memphis, Tennessee, where she stayed for another three years.[1][2][3][4]
During her fellowship, Daniel discovered the gene Kaiso, and named it after calypso (a popular form of Caribbean music).[1][2][3][4][5][6] Daniel found that Kaiso transcriptionally regulates genes involved in cell proliferation and cell adhesion.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
Following her post-doctoral fellowship, Daniel joined McMaster University's Department of Biology in November 1999, where she is now a full professor.[1][2][3][7] Prof. Daniel's lab studies triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), specifically to identify genetic risk factors which may explain the prevalence and high mortality associated with TNBC in women of African ancestry.[2][5][8][9] In 2017, Prof. Daniel's lab demonstrated that Kaiso plays a role in the proliferation and survival of TNBC cells.[10]
Prof. Daniel's research has been cited over 4,000 times and she has an h-index of 26.[11] She has been recognized for her research and mentorship by multiple awards, including 100 Accomplished Black Canadian (ABC) Women, a BBPA Harry Jerome Innovation and Technology Award, YWCA Hamilton – Woman of Distinction Award and a Gold Crown of Merit for Cancer Research, Barbados National Honor. Prof. Daniel was most recently recognized with a WXN Canada’s Most Powerful Women: Top 100 Award. [12][13][14][15]
She has received funding from both national and international agencies, including CIHR, NSERC and the US CDMRP (Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs) Breast Cancer IDEA Awards.[1][3]
Prof. Daniel mentors African Caribbean students at McMaster University, and within the community of Hamilton. Hamilton.[5] In 2006, Prof. Daniel co-founded the Canadian Multicultural LEAD Organization for Mentoring & Training.[3]
Prof. Daniel was diagnosed with breast cancer.[3][5] Following treatment, she is now healthy.[5]
