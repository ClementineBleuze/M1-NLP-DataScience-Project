She was then an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at the University of Marburg's Department of Theoretical Physics from 1985 to 1987. From 1987 until 1990, she worked as a research scientist at the University of Groningen. Erzan was briefly a  research fellow at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste before returning to Istanbul Technical University in 1990.
