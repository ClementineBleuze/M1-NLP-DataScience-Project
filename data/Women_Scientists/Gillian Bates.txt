Gillian Patricia Bates (born 19 May 1956)[1] FMedSci FRS is a British biologist. She is distinguished for her research into the molecular basis of Huntington's disease and in 1998 was awarded the GlaxoSmithKline Prize as a co-discoverer of the cause of this disease. As of 2016, she is Professor of Neurogenetics at UCL Institute of Neurology and the co-director of UCL Huntington's Disease Centre.[2][3]
Bates was educated at Kenilworth Grammar School and the University of Sheffield where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1979.[1] She completed her postgraduate study at Birkbeck College, London where she was awarded a Master of Science degree in 1984 followed by  St Mary's Hospital Medical School where she was awarded a PhD in 1987 for genetic mapping of the cystic fibrosis gene, working in the lab of Robert Williamson.[1][4]
Bates's research has focused on Huntington's disease. She was one of the group who first cloned the Huntington's disease gene.[5][6] She also created the first mouse model of the disease, the R6/2 mouse, an important step in understanding the pathogenesis of Huntington's.[7]
Prior to joining UCL in 2016, Bates was the head of the Neurogenetics Research Group at King's College London.[8]
Bates has been elected a fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1999) and a member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation (2002).[9][10][11] She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2007 and to its Council in 2011.[7][12] In 1998, she was awarded the Royal Society Glaxo Wellcome Award jointly with Stephen Davies, for the "discovery of the cause of Huntington's Disease".[13]
