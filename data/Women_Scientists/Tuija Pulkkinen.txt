Tuija I. Pulkkinen (born 1962) is a Finnish space physicist. Her primary research foci are studying 
the energy flow from the solar wind to the near-Earth space environment and the 
energy dissipation processes in the magnetosphere.
Pulkkinen was born in 1962. She received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in theoretical physics from the
University of Helsinki in 1987 and 1992.[1]
Pulkkinen's main research contributions are related to modelling current in the magnetotail during the growth of storms and 
understanding its importance for magnetotail instabilities. She has broad experience in both modeling and data analysis.
Pulkkinen received the American Geophysical Union Macelwane Medal in 1998 for outstanding research by a young scientist.[2]
Pulkkinen was affiliated with the Finnish Meteorological Institute from 1998 to 2010. In 2011 she became Dean of the School of Electrical Engineering at Aalto University; she was vice president for Research at the same institution for 2014â€“2018. She became chair of the Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering at the University of Michigan in 2018.[3]
