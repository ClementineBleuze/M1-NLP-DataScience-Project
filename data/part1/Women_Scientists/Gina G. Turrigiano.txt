Gina G. Turrigiano is an American neuroscientist, and is the Levitan Chair of Vision Science at Brandeis University.[1][2]
Turrigiano is known for her pioneering work on the mechanisms that allow brain circuits  to remain both flexible  and stable. Turrigiano and colleagues discovered several forms of "homeostatic" plasticity, most notably Synaptic Scaling, and have characterized how this form of plasticity contributes to learning and experience-dependent plastic changes in the brain. 
She graduated from Reed College, B.A., and from University of California, San Diego, with a Ph.D.
She now lives in Weston, MA with her husband, Sacha Nelson (also a neuroscientist). She has two children, Gabriel Turrigiano Nelson, and Raphael Nelson Turrigiano.
Turrigiano has published >100 research articles  in her field; her complete scholarship can be found here https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lAjsH-wAAAAJ&hl=en
