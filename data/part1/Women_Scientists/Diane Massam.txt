Diane Massam is a Canadian linguist, Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto.
She earned her PhD in linguistics under Noam Chomsky[1][2] in 1985 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[3] She held a position in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Toronto from 1989 until her retirement in 2017, when she became professor emeritus.[4][5]
Massam specializes in the syntax of Niuean, an Austronesian language spoken in the South Pacific country of Niue.[6] She developed an analysis of a type of verb plus noun compounding called noun incorporation which has opened a window to analyze similar phenomena in other languages. Her analysis also proposed a novel way of understanding the relationship between a subject and its predicate.
She was a keynote speaker at the 21st annual meeting of the Austronesian Formal Linguistics Association (AFLA) in 2014.[7]
She has served on the Advisory Board of the Canadian Journal of Linguistics, and on the Editorial Board of the journal Linguistic Inquiry. 
Massam was appointed Vice-President of the Canadian Linguistic Association in 2015. Upon completion of her two-year term in this position she served as President of the CLA from 2017 to 2019.[8][9]
