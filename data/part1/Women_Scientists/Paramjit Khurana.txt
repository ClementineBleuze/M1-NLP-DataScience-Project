Paramjit Khurana (born 15 August 1956) is an Indian scientist in Plant Biotechnology, Molecular Biology, Genomics who is presently Professor in the Department of Plant Molecular Biology in the University of Delhi, Delhi. She has received many awards and published more than 125 scientific papers.[1]
Paramjit Khurana graduated from University of Delhi with degrees in Botany; Bachelor of science degree (B.Sc.) in (1975), Master of Science degree (M.Sc.) in 1977), and Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in (1978). She obtained her doctoral degree, Ph.D. in Botany  in 1983 from University of Delhi.[1]
Khurana started her career working ad Scientist during 1983-84 in the Unit for Plant Cell and Molecular Biology Unit of the University of Delhi. She was a lecturer at Plant Biology Department the S.G.T.B. Khalsa College, University of Delhi from 1984 to 1987. During 1987-88 she worked as a Research Associate in Michigan State University (MSU), East Lansing, U.S.A. On her return from the US she has worked as Lecturer (1989–90), Reader (1990–98) and Professor (1998 to date) in the Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi, South Campus, and during 2004-07 she was Head of this Department.[2]
Khurana's career achievements cover Wheat and Seribiotechnology, Comparative Genomics, in wheat biotechnology genetic transformation of Indian wheat for resistance against the cereal cyst nematode and for abiotic stress tolerance,  development of mulberry transgenics capable of withstanding salinity and drought stress conditions, effective genetic engineering strategies leading to stress tolerance in crop plants and sustaining agriculture under changing climatic conditions, sequencing of chromosome 11 of rice, chromosome 5 of tomato, and chloroplast genome of mulberry.[1][2] As professor she has mentored 10 Post-Doctorates, 15 Ph.D scholars, 4 M.Phil. and 20 Master’s students.[1]  Her major contribution has been to develop all-weather crops which would enable rise of the India's productivity several fold. She has developed modified mulberry which can cultivated in wastelands. She says that professional goal is: "Ten years down the line, I will still be working in my laboratory. I hope my products benefit everyone."[2]
