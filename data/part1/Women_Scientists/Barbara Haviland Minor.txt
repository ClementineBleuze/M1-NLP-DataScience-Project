Barbara Haviland Minor is an American chemical engineer who has worked at DuPont (between 1981 and 2015) and Chemours (since 2015).[1] She develops new refrigerants to be used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems,[1] in Europe, North America, Australia and other countries.[2]  As of 2018, 50% of all new vehicles produced by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are believed to use her refrigerant, HFO-1234yf,[3] an important contribution to countering global warming.[1]
Minor was one of five women to be named a Dupont Fellow in 2014,[4] the first year that the company named women to its highest technical level.[5] She was awarded the Perkin Medal in 2018.[1]
Minor graduated from Bucknell University in 1981[6] with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering.[1][7]
Minor worked at DuPont from 1981 to 2015, when she moved to the spinoff company Chemours[1] in Wilmington, Delaware.[8]
Minor develops new refrigerants for air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Her work supports the phasing out of ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and of hydrofluorocarbons that contribute to global warming.[1]
Minor was the technical leader for the research group at DuPont that developed HFO-1234yf,[4][9] a hydrofluoroolefin that can reduce emissions from automotive air conditioning by more than 99%.[1] 
HFO-1234yf has a much lower global warming potential (GWP) than the previously-used R-134a: its 100-year GWP was originally calculated as 4,[10] and later recalculated as <1,[11][12] compared to 1430 for R-134a. HFO-1234yf also has a lower atmospheric lifetime (11 days compared to 14 years), and higher energy efficiency under many conditions.[10]
The Dupont team worked jointly with researchers at Honeywell.[9][10] As a replacement for R-134a, HFO-1234yf is marketed as Opteon yf by Dupont[4] (later Chemours),[13] and as Solstice yf by Honeywell.[14] 
As of 2018, 50% of new vehicles produced by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are believed to use HFO-1234yf for air conditioning.[3]
Minor helped to develop both the XP (2014) and XL (2016) lines of refrigerant for Dupont and Chemours.[15] 
In addition to alternative refrigerants for use in automobiles,[16] 
more ecologically-friendly refrigerants have been developed for supermarket refrigeration systems (XP40)[17] 
commercial freezers (XL20),[18] 
reach-in coolers and freezers (R450A),[19]
beverage coolers (HFO-1234yf),[20][21]
large building chillers (XP30),[15]
transport units with self-contained refrigeration (XP44)[15][21][8]
direct expansion air conditioning, chilled water air conditioning and heat pumps (XL41, XL55).[22]
Minor is also a co-inventor of Dupont's ISCEON MO99 (R438A), a possible replacement for R22, and Suva 95 (R508B), a possible replacement for R13 and R503.[7][23]
A number of these refrigerants involve HFO/HFC blends.[2][24]
Minor holds more than 160 patents in the United States, for her work on refrigerants, cleaning agents, and aerosol propellants.[1][25][26]
She is a member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI). She has chaired the AHRI's Research group and the AHRTI's Technology and Steering committees.[27]
