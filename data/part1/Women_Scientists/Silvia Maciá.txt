Silvia Maciá (born 1972) is an American marine biologist and professor of biology at Barry University in Miami Shores, FL. Her research interests involves both laboratory and field work addressing pipefish mating behavior, seagrass community ecology, coral reef grazing ecology and seagrass restoration.[1]
Maciá is perhaps best noted for her discovery that Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) can fly. She and her biologist husband Michael Robinson were boating on the north coast of Jamaica when she spotted something fly out of the water. She initially thought they were flying fish but after watching for a few seconds, she realized they were squid.[2]
Maciá has taught a number of courses, including marine biology, oceanography, tropical marine ecosystems, ecology, environmental science and botany. She has published over 20 academic publications, which have been cited over 500 times, resulting in an h-index of 11.[3]
