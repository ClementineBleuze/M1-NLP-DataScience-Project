Svitlana Mayboroda (born 1981) is a Ukrainian mathematician who works as a professor of mathematics at the University of Minnesota.[1]
Mayboroda's research concerns harmonic analysis and partial differential equations, including boundary value problems for elliptic partial differential equations.[2] Her work has provided a new mathematical approach to Anderson localization, a phenomenon in physics in which waves are confined to a local region rather than propagating throughout a medium, and with this explanation she can predict the regions in which waves will be confined.[3]
Mayboroda was born on June 2, 1981 in Kharkiv. She earned the Ukrainian equivalent of two master's degrees, one in finance and one in applied mathematics, from the University of Kharkiv in 2001, and completed her Ph.D. in 2005 from the University of Missouri under the supervision of Marius Mitrea.[1][4] After visiting positions at the Australian National University, Ohio State University, and Brown University, she joined the Purdue University faculty in 2008, and moved to the University of Minnesota in 2011.[1]
Mayboroda was a Sloan Research Fellow for 2010â€“2015.[1]
In 2013, she became the inaugural winner of the Sadosky Research Prize in Analysis of the Association for Women in Mathematics.[2]
In 2015 she was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[5] In 2016, she was awarded the first Northrop Professorship at the University of Minnesota.[6]
She is an invited speaker at the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians, speaking in the section on Analysis and Operator Algebras.[7]
