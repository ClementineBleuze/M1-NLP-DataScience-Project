Ann Elizabeth Nelson (April 29, 1958 – August 4, 2019) was a particle physicist and professor of physics in the Particle Theory Group at the University of Washington from 1994 until her death.[1][2][3] Nelson received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2004,[4] and she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011[5] and the National Academy of Sciences in 2012.[6] She was a recipient of the 2018 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics, presented annually by the American Physical Society and considered one of the most prestigious prizes in physics.[7]
Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,[8] Nelson earned her Bachelor of Science degree at Stanford University in 1980,[9] and her Ph.D. degree at Harvard University under the supervision of Howard Georgi in 1984.[10]
After a post doctoral fellowship at the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1984-1987, Nelson became an assistant professor at Stanford University in 1987. In 1990 Nelson moved to UC San Diego, and then in 1994 moved for the final time her career to the University of Washington.[11]
Nelson and her collaborators are known for a number of theories, including:
Nelson was married to David B. Kaplan, also a professor of physics at the University of Washington. She had been an active member of The Mountaineers club in Seattle since 1994. She had two children.[19]
Nelson was an activist for equal rights throughout her life. In 1980, when graduating from Stanford University, she and her husband wore colored ribbons to protest Stanford's investments in Apartheid South Africa. In 2017, she led physics lectures in Palestine to support social justice and promote diversity in science fields around the world.[3] She advocated for greater representation of women in physics research.[20]
On August 4, 2019, while hiking Iron Cap Mountain in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness with her husband and two friends, Nelson lost her footing and died after falling into a rocky gully. Her husband and fellow hikers were rescued on August 4 by a Spokane helicopter crew. Her body was recovered on August 6.[2][21][22]
