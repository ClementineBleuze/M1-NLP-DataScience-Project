Ju-Lee Kim (김주리, born 1969) is a South Korean mathematician who works as a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Her research involves the representation theory of p-adic groups.[1]
Kim completed her undergraduate studies at KAIST in 1991,[1] and earned a Ph.D. from Yale University in 1997 supervised by Roger Howe;[1][2] at Yale, she was also mentored by Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro.
After postdoctoral study at the Institute for Advanced Study and the École Normale Supérieure, she joined the faculty as an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in 1998.[3] Kim joined the faculty at University of Illinois at Chicago in 2002, and then moved to MIT in 2007.[4]
In 2015 she was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society "for contributions to the representation theory of semisimple groups over nonarchimedean local fields and for service to the profession."[5]
Her husband, Paul Seidel, is also a mathematician at MIT.[4]
