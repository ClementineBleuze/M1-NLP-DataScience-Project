Katalin Balázsi (née Sedláčková; born 1978) is a Slovakia-born Hungarian material scientist.  She is the head of the Thin Film Physics department in the Institute of Technical Physics and Materials Science, a component of the Centre for Energy Research, Eötvös Lóránd Research Network.  She has also served as the President of the Association of Hungarian Women in Science (2018-2021).
Balázsi was born in Šahy (Ipolyság), Slovakia in 1978.[1]  While in elementary school, she represented her school in mathematics competitions.  For high school, her father enrolled her in an electrician high school: there were four other girls in her class, and thirty-two boys.  She graduated with the top ranking in her class.[2]
Balázsi completed her university degrees at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava (STU).  In 2000, she received a bachelor's degree in Electromaterials Engineering; she received a master's degree in materials science in 2002 from the same.[3]  During her master's degree, Balázsi worked as a technician at the Slovak Academy of Sciences.  She then became a researcher at the Academy,[2] using transmission electron microscopy to characterise the structures of nanomaterials; she received her doctorate in materials science from the STU in 2005.[4]  The Institute of Electrical Engineering at the Academy named her the "Young Researcher".[3]
In 2006, Balázsi became a research fellow at the Institute of Technical Physics and Materials Science, part of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  She was appointed as a senior scientist at the Institute's Centre for Energy Research in 2012.[3]  Besides her work with electron microscopy, Balázsi has also studied the development of different ceramic materials.[5]
Balázsi and nine other female scientists founded the Association of Hungarian Women in Science in 2008 to address the national gender imbalance in Hungary's science sector; this Association won the first Nature Research Innovating Science Award in 2018.[6][7]  She has served as the Association's president from 2018 to 2021.[8]   She also received the 2021 Acta Materialia Mary Fortune Global Diversity Medal.[3]
In 2021, she became the second Hungarian fellow of the European Ceramic Society (ECerS).[9]  She is a board member of the European Platform of Women Scientists (EPWS).[10]  She has also been secretary of the Hungarian Society for Material Sciences (2013-2020),  as well as secretary and treasurer of the Hungarian Microscopic Society (2018-2022).[8]
Her husband Csaba Balázsi is also a scientist.  They have two sons.[11]  Besides Hungarian, she speaks Slovak, Czech, and English.[1]
