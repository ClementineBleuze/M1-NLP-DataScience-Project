Renée Hložek (born 15 November 1983) is a South African cosmologist, Professor of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, and an Azrieli Global Scholar within the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.[1] She studies the cosmic microwave background, Type Ia supernova and baryon acoustic oscillations. She is a Senior TED Fellow and was made a Sloan Research Fellow in 2020.
Hložek studied Mathematics at the University of Pretoria and the University of Cape Town graduating in 2008.[2][3] During her undergraduate studies she worked on dark energy.[4] She completed her PhD at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 2011.[5][3] Her thesis, "Probing the early universe and Dark Energy with multi-epoch cosmological data", used the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and Sloan Digital Sky Survey.[6] Her doctoral advisor was Jo Dunkley.[6] During her time at Oxford, she appeared on Chris Lintott's Pub Astronomy podcast and 365 Days of Astronomy.[7][8]
After her PhD Hložek joined Princeton University as a Lyman Spitzer Jr. Postdoctoral Research Fellow.[2] At Princeton University she prepared for the polarisation-sensitive Atacama Cosmology Telescope.[2] In 2012 she was appointed a Spitzer-Cotsen Fellow at Princeton University.[2][9] At Princeton she took part in a prison teaching initiative, and formed the Hope-Princeton exchange to bring young black women into Princeton's astronomy departments.[2][10] She took part in the Story Collider.[11] In 2013 she took part in the Science Train started by Lucianne Walkowicz at Princeton, where she took to the New York City Subway to talk to the public about astronomy.[12]
She joined the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics in 2016.[13] She continues to work with the polarisation instrument on the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, alongside data from Planck and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and BICEP and Keck Array.[14] She looks to classify radio transient signals using the Algonquin 46m radio telescope.[15] She has worked with the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.[16] In 2017 she took part in the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Untangling the Cosmos event.[17] In 2020 she was awarded a Sloan Research Fellow.[18]
Hložek was named a TED Fellow in 2012 and a Senior Fellow in 2014.[19] Her contribution to TEDed "The death of the universe" has been viewed 1.1 Million times.[20][21] She has spoken at several TED events, including the 2014 TED conference in Vancouver.[22][23][24][25] She takes part in several activities to improve gender balance in science.[26][27][28][29][30]
