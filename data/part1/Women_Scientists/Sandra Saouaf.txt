Sandra Saouaf is an American immunologist who researches autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and others.
Sandra Jerrold-Jones obtained a BA from Rutgers College in biochemistry and went on to earn a PhD in immunology from the University of Pennsylvania.[1] After completion of her degree, Saouaf went to work in the cell signaling laboratory of Bristol-Myers Squibb[2][3] where she completed her post doctorate fellowship.[4] She then worked briefly at GlaxoSmithKline before returning to the University of Pennsylvania.[2]  Saouaf left the university and began a consulting business with pharmaceutical and biotechnical companies,[2] hoping to help speed the process of discoveries for drugs to treat autoimmune disease. In 2012, together with University of Pennsylvania colleagues, she "discovered a possible treatment approach...through oral drugs" and founded Atlantic Bio Sci, LLC.[1] In 2013, she won a Fellowship from the Alliance of Women Entrepreneurs.[5]
