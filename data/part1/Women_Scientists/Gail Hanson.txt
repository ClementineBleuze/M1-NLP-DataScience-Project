Gail G. Hanson, born 22 February 1947 in Dayton, Ohio[1] is an American experimental particle physicist.
Hanson received her PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973.[2] She spent sixteen years at SLAC, first as a research assistant and then as a permanent staff member.[3] Whilst there, Hanson participated in the discovery of the J/psi meson and tau lepton.  Her work led to the first evidence for quark jet production in electron-positron annihilation,[4] for which she was awarded the 1996 Panofsky Prize with Roy Schwitters.[3]
In 2002 she was appointed Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of California, Riverside.[2]
