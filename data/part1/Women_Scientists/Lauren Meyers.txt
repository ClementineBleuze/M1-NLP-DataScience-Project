Lauren Ancel Meyers is an American integrative biologist who holds the Denton A. Cooley Centennial Professorship in Zoology at the University of Texas at Austin.[2] She is also a member of the Santa Fe Institute External Faculty.[3]
Meyers earned her Bachelor of Arts degree, magna cum laude, in mathematics and philosophy at Harvard University (1996) and her PhD in biological sciences at Stanford University (2000).[1] She then did post-doctoral work with the National Science Foundation for two years.[2]
Meyers specializes in network epidemiology and works in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies on diseases such as COVID-19, pandemic influenza, Ebola, HIV, Swine flu,[4] and Zika.[3] When the COVID-19 pandemic appeared she quickly realized it presented a unique danger and had long feared about such a pandemic. Her team formed the COVID-19 Modeling Consortium and coordinates with the  White House Coronavirus Task Force.[5][6] Meyers and other epidemiologists knew that the 2009 swine flu pandemic could have been much worse and that much better preparations for a future pandemic were needed. She is concerned that people will not take necessary precautions for the COVID-19 pandemic.[4] Her team discovered that every day of delay in implementing social distancing measures added 2.4 days to the length of an outbreak.[7] On 30 June 2020, she predicted that without major and quick behavior change at least some locales will require a Stage 5 (red) shutdown.[8] Meyers emphasizes that COVID-19 does spread silently.[9][10] Meyers further states that trait of COVID-19, coupled with its rapid transmission interval, only an average of 4 days, makes COVID-19 very dangerous. By comparison, this is very different from SARS, which has an 8-day transmission interval and is more visible.[9][11]
